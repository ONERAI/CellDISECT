Beta Versions
------------

0.2.0b1 (2024-03-16)
------------------

* Beta release with compatibility updates
* Updates:
    * Compatible with Google Colab
    * Support for newer torch versions (>=2.1.0, <2.3.0)
    * Support for newer scvi-tools versions (>=1.0.0, <=1.3.0)
* Note:
    * This beta version is designed to work with modern environments while the main branch remains for reproducibility
    * Although this version introduces breaking changes, it is still backward compatible with the previous version (training and numerical process could be different due to different torch versions, hence slightly different results)
